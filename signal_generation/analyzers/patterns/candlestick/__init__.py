"""
Candlestick Patterns Module

Individual candlestick pattern detectors.
Each pattern has its own file for better maintainability.

# Patterns will be imported here as they are implemented
# Example:
# from signal_generation.analyzers.patterns.candlestick.hammer import HammerPattern
# from signal_generation.analyzers.patterns.candlestick.engulfing import EngulfingPattern

__all__ = [
    # Will be populated as patterns are implemented
