"""
Chart Patterns Module

Individual chart pattern detectors.
Each pattern has its own file for better maintainability.

# Patterns will be imported here as they are implemented
# Example:
# from signal_generation.analyzers.patterns.chart.double_top_bottom import DoubleTopBottomPattern
# from signal_generation.analyzers.patterns.chart.head_shoulders import HeadShouldersPattern

__all__ = [
    # Will be populated as patterns are implemented
